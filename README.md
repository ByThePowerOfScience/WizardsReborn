# About:

"Wizard's Reborn" - the quintessence of all the author's favorite magic mods

Inspired by Thaumcraft, Embers, Eidolon, Malum, Electroblob's Wizardry and Astral Sorcery, Wizard's Reborn is a story about magical matters and their manipulation. Everything is divided into four elements, which will help you explore this unusual world.

Ancient crystals can be found underground, containing a primordial power of a sacred knowledge, called "wissen" capable of transforming matter.

Using the power of wissen, you can grow crystals that can refract energy to release it in the form of a magical physical object.

The mod adds magical materials, spells and mechanisms.

Various mechanisms are set in motion due to the power of wissen.
