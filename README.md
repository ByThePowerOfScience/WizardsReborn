# About:

"Wizard's Reborn" - the quintessence of all the author's favorite magic mods

Inspired by Thaumcraft, Embers, Eidolon, Malum, Electroblob's Wizardry and Astral Sorcery, Wizard's Reborn is a story about magical matters and their manipulation. Everything is divided into four elements, which will help you explore this unusual world.

Ancient crystals can be found underground, containing a primordial power of a sacred knowledge, called "wissen" capable of transforming matter.

Using the power of wissen, you can grow crystals that can refract energy to release it in the form of a magical physical object.

The mod adds magical materials, spells and mechanisms.

Crystals that you have to grow yourself. They have different properties that will affect the spells of your magic wand.
